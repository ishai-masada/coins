# LESSON NOTES [2021-02-22]

- Shebang lines (starting with #!) tell Unix-based operating systems what
  program to run a file with.

  Examples:
    * #!/bin/python3
    * #!/bin/bash

- To make a file executable you need to give it the necessary permissions. Do so
  with the following command:

  sudo chmod +x FILENAME

  Don't forget that to run a file outside of your path you have to prefix it
  with the directory.

  Examples:
    * ./FILENAME (for current directory)
    * ~/code/bank/FILENAME (~ always refers to your home directory)
    * etc...

  To 'install' a program by moving it into your path, run the following command:

  sudo mv FILENAME /usr/local/bin/

  Assuming you've already run the chmod command, it can now be run normally from
  anywhere on your computer.

- f-strings allow formatting by suffixing your variable name with a colon and
  the desired parameters.

  Examples
    f'{math.pi}' -> '3.141592653589793'
    f'{math.pi:.2f}' -> '3.14'
    f'{math.pi:.2f}' -> '3.14'
    f'{age}'         -> '21'
    f'{age:4d}'      -> '  21'
    f'{age:04d}'     -> '0021'
    f'{year}'        -> '2021'
    f'{year:,}'      -> '2,021'

  This is all based on the printf() format from C, but you can also google
  something like 'python f-string format cheat sheet' to get some handy info.

- Python classes can inherit from other classes to expand on them.

  Example:

    class Object:
        def __init__(self, name, value, weight):
            self.name = name
            self.value = value
            self.weight = weight

        def value_weight_ratio():
            return self.value / self.weight

    class WaterBottle(Object):
        def drink(self):
            self.weight -= 0.5
            self.value -= 1

    bottle = WaterBottle('Aquafina', 4, 2)
    print(bottle.weight) -> 4
    bottle.drink()
    print(bottle.weight) -> 3.5
